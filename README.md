# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows
Data cleaning and preprocessing project on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Python (Pandas, ast). Tasks include handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and preparing the dataset for further analysis or visualization.
# Sammary :- In this data cleaning project, I processed a dataset containing information about movies and TV shows. I started by removing duplicate entries to maintain data integrity. Missing values in critical columns such as title were dropped, while others like description and age_certification were filled with default values such as "No description available" and "NR" (Not Rated). The seasons column, often missing for movies, was filled with 0 and converted to integers for consistency. Numerical columns (imdb_score, imdb_votes, tmdb_popularity, tmdb_score) had missing values replaced with their respective column averages. Additionally, the genres and production_countries columns, originally in string format, were converted into proper Python lists for easier analysis. Any missing imdb_id values were filled with a placeholder ID. The final result is a clean, complete, and well-structured dataset ready for further data analysis and visualization.
